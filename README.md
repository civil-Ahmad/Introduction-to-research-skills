The scripts gives a comparison of the capacity curves for the reference model and the modified model.

The reference model is abbreviated by "M5_L_FF_MMM" which is obtained by mean value of the 3 following parameters:
MMM: for mean values of mean_E=1340e6 [Pa], mean_C=0.075e6 [Pa] mean_mu=0.477 [-] and we have also the following
abbrevations for the 2 models:
M5 :clay stone materail, L:lowrise, FF:flexible

The model "M5_L_FF_NS_InterPiers_L2100toL2720" is the modified model for mean values of E,c and mu and
for lowrise clay stone(M5) with internal facade walls' changes (openning)
from 2100 mm to 2720 mm

Results:

The elapsed time is 262.8 s (4.38 mins) to run the code

Observations:

1. Regarding Ty, fundamental period of building , it is not obtained by this plot however by other analysis we can see that it is a better one
than the Ty of reference model.
2. Regarding sdy, yielding displacement, we have a slightly worse sdy than before, 0.0047 m instead of 0.0052 m
3. Concerning sdu, the ultimate displacement, we do not have a better result: which can be seen from the plot
4. we can also see that we have a better capacity shear result (y-axis).
